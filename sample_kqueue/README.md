# Kqueue Sample Loop
A sample code of Kqueue event loop.


```
# start the server
$ c++ -o serve colors.cpp server_http.cpp
$ ./server
  
# start the client in a separate terminal
$ go run client_http.go

you can access to the server by browser (localhost:6868)  
and check the HTTP request sent by that browser.  
```
